# Bankruptcy Prediction

## Project Description
In this project, I work with financial data from the [Emerging Markets Information Service](https://www.emis.com). I look at financial indicators from Poland and Taiwan, and build machine learning models that predict bankruptcy.

### Overview
* Addressed imbalanced data using resampling techniques.
* Evaluated models using classification metrics using precision and recall.
* Improved bankruptcy models using random forest and gradient boosting.
* Evaluated model generalizability using cross validation.
* Tuned model hyperparameters using grid search.
* Built prediction functions that use saved models.
* Created Python modules to store prediction functions.

### Tools & Libraries
* Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
