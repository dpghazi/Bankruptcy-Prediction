# Bankruptcy Prediction

## Project Description
In this project, I work with financial data from the [Emerging Markets Information Service](https://www.emis.com). I look at financial indicators from Poland and Taiwan, and build machine learning models that predict bankruptcy.

### Overview
* Address imbalanced data using resampling techniques
* Evaluate models using classification metrics using precision and recall
* Improve bankruptcy models using random forest and gradient boosting
* Evaluate model generalizability using cross validation
* Tune model hyperparameters using grid search
* Build prediction functions that use saved models
* Create Python modules to store prediction functions

### Tools & Libraries
* Python
* Jupyter
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
